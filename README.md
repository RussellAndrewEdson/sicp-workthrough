sicp-workthrough
================

My solutions as I work through the SICP wizard book.

These are my solutions to the exercises (and eventually, perhaps the additional programming assignments) for the Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs book. I'm currently working through it as part of my computer science self-study, and it seems like everyone has a repository for their own solutions to this thing, so figured I'd jump on the bandwagon too.

(The online text is available at http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html)

The programming environment that I'm using for the exercises is the DrRacket integrated development environment (http://racket-lang.org/), together with Neil Van Dyke's SICP support package (http://www.neilvandyke.org/racket-sicp/).
